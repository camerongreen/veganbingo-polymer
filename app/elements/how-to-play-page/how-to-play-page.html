      </h2>
      <div><p>If you know how traditional Bingo works, you are well on the way to understanding <b>Vegan Bingo</b> though in this game you have to complete all the squares.  If you don't know how Bingo works well worry not, read on, it is very simple.</p>

        <p>You start with a board of pictures/icons, each one representing things people commmonly say to vegans.</p>

        <p>You might like to start by tapping/clicking each of the icons to see what they represent and read some more info.</p>

        <p>When someone says one of them to you, you then say Vegan Bingo!  You go and click on its icon and press the button to say you've completed it. A red <b>X</b> will now appear on the screen for that item showing it as checked off.</p>

        <p>Your aim is to check as many off as possible and once you have done them all you will have completed Vegan Bingo!</p>

        <p>Vegan bingo is a fun game for vegans, not to make fun of non-vegans; veganism was new to most of us at one point and we might have asked similar questions before enlightenment descended ;)</p></div>
